### **Train and Deploy a Multimodal AI Model- PyTorch, AWS, SageMaker, Next.js 15, React, Tailwind:**

We'll learn how to train and deploy a multimodal AI model from scratch using PyTorch. The model will accept a video as its input, and predict its sentiment and emotion. When training the model, you'll build features like text, video, and audio encoding, multimodal fusion, and emotion and sentiment classification. After training and deploying the model, you'll build a SaaS around your trained model, where users can run inference on their videos through your API. You'll set up invocation of the deployed model with SageMaker Endpoints, and manage the monthly quotas users have. The SaaS will be built with technologies such as Next.js, React, Tailwind, and Auth.js and is based off of the T3 Stack. You'll be able to build along with me from start to finish.
